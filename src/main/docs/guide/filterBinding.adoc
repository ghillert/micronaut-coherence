Filter binding annotations are normal annotations that are themselves annotated with the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/annotation/FilterBinding.html[@FilterBinding] meta-annotation.
A filter binding annotation represents a Coherence link:{coherenceApi}/com/tangosol/util/Filter.html[Filter] and is used to specify a `Filter` in certain injection points, for example a View (CQC), `NamedTopic` `Subscriber` beans, event listeners, etc.

There are three parts to using a filter binding:

* The filter binding annotation
* An implementation of a link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/FilterFactory.html[FilterFactory] that is annotated with the filter binding annotation. This is a factory that produces the required `Filter`.
* Injection points annotated with the filter binding annotation.

For example; assume there is a Coherence `NamedMap` with the name `people` that contains `Person` instances for the value.
Among the various properties on the `Person` class is a property called `gender` and property called `age`.
Now assume we want to inject a view that only shows adult males, we would need a `Filter` that has a condition like `gender == "male" && age > 18".

=== Create the filter binding annotation

First create a simple annotation, it could be called something like `AdultMales`

[source,java]
----
@FilterBinding                         // <1>
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface AdultMales {         // <2>
}
----
<1> The annotation class is annotated with `@FilterBinding`
<2> The annotation name is `AdultMales`

In this case the annotation does not need any other attributes.

=== Create the `FilterFactory`

Now create the link:{api}/io/micronaut/coherence/FilterFactory.html[FilterFactory] implementation that will produce instances of the required `Filter`.

[source,java]
----
import com.tangosol.util.Filter;
import com.tangosol.util.Filters;
import io.micronaut.coherence.FilterFactory;

@AdultMales    // <1>
@Singleton     // <2>
public class AdultMalesFilterFactory<Person> implements FilterFactory<AdultMales, Person> {
    @Override
    public Filter<Person> create(AdultMales annotation) {       // <3>
        Filter<Person> male = Filters.equal("gender", "male");
        Filter<Person> adult = Filters.greaterEqual(Extractors.extract("age"), 18);
        return Filters.all(male, adult);
    }
}
----
<1> The class is annotated with the `AdultMales` filter binding annotation
<2> The class must be a Micronaut bean, in this case a singleton
<3> The `create` method uses the Coherence `filters` API to create the required `filter`.

The parameter to the `create` method is the annotation used on the injection point.
In this case the annotation has no values, but if it did we could access those values to customize how the filter is created.

For example, we could have just called the annotation `@Adults` and made the gender a parameter like this:
[source,java]
----
@FilterBinding
@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
public @interface Adults {
    String value();
}
----

And changed the filter factory:
[source,java]
----
@Adult
@Singleton
public class AdultFilterFactory<Person> implements FilterFactory<Adults, Person> {
    @Override
    public Filter<Person> create(Males annotation) {       // <3>
        Filter<Person> male = Filters.equal("gender", annotation.value());
        Filter<Person> adult = Filters.greaterEqual(Extractors.extract("age"), 18);
        return Filters.all(male, adult);
    }
}
----

=== Annotate the Injection Point

Now the application code where the view is to be injected can use the custom filter binding annotation.

[source,java]
----
@View               // <1>
@AdultMales         // <2>
@Name("people")     // <3>
private NamedMap<String, Person> adultMales;
----
<1> The `@View` annotation indicates that this is a view rather than a plain `NamedMap`
<2> The `@AdultMales` annotation links to the custom filter factory to use to create the filter for the view
<3> The `@Name` annotation indicates the underlying cache/map name to use for the view
